# Automated-Garbage-Sorter
Modern world meets lots of challenges that includes Smart
waste management system. It is become matter of big concern
if proper disposal system is not managed. Managing waste
effectively and recycling efficiently, a nation can ahead one
step forward. In this work, an automatic sorter machine is developed
which can sort out the wastes in various categories to make waste management 
easier and efficient. It can be possible to sort out metal, paper, plastics and 
glass by developing an electromechanical system using microcontroller and operational
amplifier. For sorting metal and glass conventional sensors are used and for sorting
paper and plastics a sensor using LASER and LDR is developed. A weight sensor and counter
is used to find out the amount of sorted materials. By using the proper recycling system,
the curse of waste will turn into blessings for the civilization. The sorting procedure will
make recycling more efficient. By means of this waste sorter, the conventional waste management
system will be transformed into SMART system. This SMART system will help to make our environment 
more suitable for living, reducing global warming and making the world healthier.
